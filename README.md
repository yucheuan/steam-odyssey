### Intro
#### Summary:
Making tailored furniture must go through a series of professional processes from formal-functional design, sourcing, and fabrication, which is barely possible for people to fulfill.

The goal of this project is to use augmented reality technology to guide user, who looks for unique and affordable furniture, through every essential step.

#### Problem Definition:
With many big manufacturers, e.g., IKEA, people can easily find the furniture that fits their daily needs. However, there is a little customized furniture manufacturer that is affordable for people who just want one or a few pieces of tailored furniture.

As for making tailored furniture, this needs a certain degree of professional knowledge, information on sourcing material, proper visualization for design scale and aesthetics, and accurate instructions for fabrication.

#### Ideation:
In order to fulfill the whole design and fabrication process at affordable expense, we design an end-to-end approach to facilitate design decision-making and guide how to source materials from big retailers, e.g., The Home Depot, and how to fabricate their furniture.
